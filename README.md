USB Impersonator
Note: I no longer recommend this project be built.  These files are provided as a reference for academic purposes.    
FTDI changed the libraries which tends to break this device.  I would recommend building the UDeck which is based on the 
BeagleBone and has better performance and flexibility as an alternative.
